UnauthorizedAccess:EC2/SSHBruteForce

Attack instance attacks the webserver instance using SSH brute force and hence gaining access by guessing passwords. 

2.AWS Guard Duty documentation regarding how it might have detected the attack

GuardDuty monitors traffic on certain specific ports such as port 22.
If SSH services are configured to use other ports, it will not be detected by Guard Duty.


From Guard Duty documentation:

"Amazon GuardDuty is a continuous security monitoring service that analyzes and processes the
following data sources: VPC Flow Logs, AWS CloudTrail event logs, and DNS logs"

In this instance , VPC Flow Logs would be the source to show the attack attempts.
