1. Additional architectural changes that can be made to reduce attack to web application instance.

Disable ssh access on the instance. To establish a session, Systems Manager can be utilized for a more secured connection.

2. Assuming the IAM permissions for the S3 bucket are still insecure, would creating VPC private endpoints for S3 prevent the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket.

Nope, it won't prevent any unauthorized access to the bucket, what it does is to keep the traffic flow between the resources/services within the VPC and not from the internet. 

3. Will applying default encryption setting to the s3 buckets encrypt the data that already exists?

Nope, only the newly created objects will get encrypted. To encrypt the existing ones, we'll need to delete the existing files and re-upload the files again.

4. What would happen if the original cloud formation templates are applied to this environment.

The state of the resouces would get back to the original and all changes done throught the console will be lost.
