Poor practice 1
---------------
In the VPC configuration, the route configurations have DestinationCidrBlock as 0.0.0.0/0.
This could mean that the hacker can send the data to any ip address of choice, inside or outside the VPC.

Poor practice 2
---------------
The web application is configured to be deployed into the public instance which is internet facing. It should have rather been deployed to a private instance to protect it from the attack.
